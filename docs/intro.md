SymphonyQL allows you to write GraphQL servers for both Scala and Java built in the same way. It is built at the top of the [pekko-streams](https://github.com/apache/incubator-pekko).

## Highlights

- support for Java 21: record classes, sealed interface.
- minimal dependencies, no adapter required.
- native support for [Apache Pekko](https://github.com/apache/incubator-pekko), including Java and Scala.
- minimal amount of boilerplate: no need to manually define a schema for every type in your API.
